## Overview

`cran-logs` is a [Shiny](https://shiny.posit.co/) dashboard for visualizing package download statistics from the Comprehensive R Archive Network ([CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/)).

The dashboard supports query strings for direct access to specific package statistics. For example: <https://danielvartan.shinyapps.io/cran-logs/?package=dplyr>.
